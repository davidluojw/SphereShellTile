
- MakeTile.m can be used to generate a NURBS patch representing a spherical tile, starting from 4 vertex points on the unit sphere
- The subfolders contain the control point data of the respective tilings. A NURBS structure of a single tile is created using ...Load.m. An array of NURBS structures representing the entire tiling is created by running Multi_SphereFrom....m with the previous structure as input.
